## 1. Scenario

<!-- 100–150 words, labels included. One small scenario, used in every prompt and in your
     whole answer. Anything fictional is labelled in Assumptions. -->

**Question:**What social challenges—like privacy, safety, and accountability—come up when using a software-controlled drone for building inspections, and how do we design practical safeguards for them? 

**Users:**Commercial building property managers (who operate the system), certified remote pilots (who supervise flights), and urban maintenance workers (who review the resulting data). (All user personas and names are fictional).

**Problem:**Inspecting high-rise building facades using human workers on scaffolding or ropes is risky, slow, and expensive. However, using automated drones introduces serious risks: they can crash into pedestrians, and their cameras can easily peer into private apartment windows.

**Constraints:**
1.The drone's software must work within strict hardware limits, meaning a maximum continuous flight time of 25 minutes per battery charge.
2.Operations must follow local aviation laws, which prohibit fully automated flights out of the pilot's line of sight directly over public sidewalks during busy hours.

**Risk:**Losing GPS or compass signals in urban "canyons" (between tall buildings), which can cause the drone to drift and crash into glass facades or bystanders.

**Assumptions:**The fictional company running this is "SkyView Inspections LLC," operating in a fictional city under standard municipal drone guidelines. All specific metrics are fictional and assumed for this exercise.

**5 theses:**
1.Software is more than just code: Delivering a reliable inspection drone isn't just about writing a good autopilot script. It requires a complete toolkit—clear sensor-calibration guides, rigorous stress-test logs, and an emergency recovery manual for when things go wrong.

2.The illusion of full automation: Fully autonomous flight in a crowded city is a risky myth. Engineers have to design systems that keep a human pilot in the loop, ensuring there is always an instant way to override the drone and take manual control.

3.Physics always wins over software ambitions: Great ideas—like running heavy, real-time AI privacy filters on board—often fail because of hard physical limits, such as a strict 25-minute battery cap and limited onboard processing power.

4.Designing for failure ("urban canyons"): Losing GPS signals between skyscrapers isn't a rare emergency; it's a normal urban condition. The software has to expect it, using backup sensors to keep the drone stable instead of letting it drift into a building.

5.Privacy by design, not as an afterthought: Because an inspection drone's high-res camera will inevitably peer into nearby apartments, protecting people's privacy isn't something you fix later with a quick software patch—it has to be built directly into how flight paths and data are handled from day one.

## 2. Analysis

<!-- 350–400 words. Your answer to the question, the trade-offs, and how it applies to your
     scenario. Explain at least two engineering decisions and why they fit the scenario. -->

(write here)

## 3. Review

<!-- 250–300 words. What Prompt B's critique said and what you did with it; your two source
     checks and your two substantive revisions, each with a reason. Point at the rows of the
     tables in section 9 ("verification row 2", "change-log row 1"). -->

## 4. Conclusion

<!-- 100–150 words. Your recommendation for the scenario and its main limitation. -->

(write here)

## 5. Reflection

<!-- 150–200 words. NOT part of the main total. Written by you, not by the assistant:
     what helped, what you changed, what you learned. Specific beats flattering. -->
